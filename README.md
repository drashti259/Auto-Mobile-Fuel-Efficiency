# Auto-Mobile-Fuel-Efficiency
The project aimed to predict car fuel efficiency (mpg) using R Studio. Data from Kaggle was cleaned and analyzed using correlation and linear regression. Key variables influencing mpg were identified, and residual analysis was performed to check model accuracy. The best model was chosen based on metrics like R-squared and RMSE.
